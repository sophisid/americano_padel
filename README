# Americano Padel Scheduler

Welcome to the most over-engineered Americano Padel scheduler you will ever see.
This Python script takes a simple CSV of player names and generates a fully structured Americano-style tournament schedule.

It supports three scheduling modes depending on how many players you have and how mathematically perfect you want the format to be.

---

## Features

* Import players from a CSV (with a single column called `name`).
* Three scheduling modes, depending on how chaotic your group is:

### 1. Strict Mode (default)

* Works only when the number of players is a **multiple of 4**.
* Guarantees that each pair of players are **teammates exactly once**.

### 2. Balanced Mode (`--balanced`)

* Also requires the number of players to be a **multiple of 4**.
* For 4 players: produces the classic perfect Americano (teammates once, opponents twice).
* For 8, 12, 16…

  * Each pair becomes teammates **N/4 times**.
  * Opponents are spread more fairly through cyclic rotations.

### 3. Loose Mode (`--loose`)

* Works for **any even number of players ≥ 4**, including 6, 10, 14, etc.

* Uses a symmetric rotation heuristic.

* Not mathematically perfect, but very fair (and very practical).

* Export the schedule to a CSV ready for scorekeeping.

* Compute total player points from filled-in match results.

## Installation

Clone the repo and navigate inside:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

You only need Python 3.8+ and the standard library.

---

## Players CSV Format

Your input CSV must look like this:

```csv
name
Sophia
Ioanna
Maria
Kostis
Stylianos
Achilleas
Aldo
Kelado
...
```

Only one column is required: `name`.

---

## Generate a Schedule

### Strict Mode (default)

```bash
python americano_padel.py generate players.csv -o schedule.csv
```

Works only when the number of players is a multiple of 4.

---

### Loose Mode (for 6 players, 10 players, etc)

```bash
python americano_padel.py generate players.csv --loose -o schedule.csv
```

Loose mode skips strict constraints and produces a balanced rotation for any even number ≥ 4.

---

### Balanced Mode

```bash
python americano_padel.py generate players.csv --balanced -o schedule.csv
```

* Only works when players are a multiple of 4.
* For 4 players: produces the perfect Americano (3 matches).
* For more: each teammate pair appears N/4 times while opponents distribute more evenly.

## Example Schedule Output

```csv
match_id,team1_p1,team1_p2,team2_p1,team2_p2,team1_score,team2_score
1,Sophia,Kelado,Kostis,Maria,,
2,Stylianos,Ioanna,Achilleas,Aldo,,
3,Sophia,Maria,Kelado,Ioanna,,
4,Kostis,Aldo,Stylianos,Achilleas,,
5,Sophia,Ioanna,Maria,Aldo,,
6,Kelado,Achilleas,Kostis,Stylianos,,
7,Sophia,Aldo,Ioanna,Achilleas,,
8,Maria,Stylianos,Kelado,Kostis,,
9,Sophia,Achilleas,Aldo,Stylianos,,
10,Ioanna,Kostis,Maria,Kelado,,
11,Sophia,Stylianos,Achilleas,Kostis,,
12,Aldo,Kelado,Ioanna,Maria,,
13,Sophia,Kostis,Stylianos,Kelado,,
14,Achilleas,Maria,Aldo,Ioanna,,
...
```

You or your friends can later fill in the scores.

## Add Scores and Compute Rankings

After playing, fill the score columns:

```csv
match_id,team1_p1,team1_p2,team2_p1,team2_p2,team1_score,team2_score
1,Sophia,Kelado,Kostis,Maria,0,29
2,Stylianos,Ioanna,Achilleas,Aldo,23,6
3,Sophia,Maria,Kelado,Ioanna,5,24
4,Kostis,Aldo,Stylianos,Achilleas,20,9
5,Sophia,Ioanna,Maria,Aldo,15,14
6,Kelado,Achilleas,Kostis,Stylianos,23,6
7,Sophia,Aldo,Ioanna,Achilleas,23,6
8,Maria,Stylianos,Kelado,Kostis,0,29
9,Sophia,Achilleas,Aldo,Stylianos,25,4
10,Ioanna,Kostis,Maria,Kelado,24,5
11,Sophia,Stylianos,Achilleas,Kostis,24,5
12,Aldo,Kelado,Ioanna,Maria,10,19
13,Sophia,Kostis,Stylianos,Kelado,12,17
14,Achilleas,Maria,Aldo,Ioanna,3,26

...
```

Then run:

```bash
python americano_padel.py scores schedule.csv
```

Example output:

```
Player rankings (total points):
 1. Ioanna: 137 points
 2. Kostis: 125 points
 3. Kelado: 108 points
 4. Sophia: 104 points
 5. Aldo: 103 points
 6. Stylianos: 83 points
 7. Achilleas: 77 points
 8. Maria: 75 points
```

If someone complains... remind them that the scoreboard is now automated and therefore objective.
